The **python-poker-engine** is a simple poker engine that supports

  * hand evaluation and comparisons;
  * table/game management; and
  * tournament management.

The python-poker-engine uses an event-based system to decouple the engine from a particular user interface or networking architecture.  We wish to create several different poker clients for homebrew tournaments amongst small groups of players, targeting desktop operating systems and possibly mobile phones (e.g. iphone).
